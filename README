MITM-forking.py acts as an HTTP proxy sitting b/w the browser and the web with the ability to
inject/remove arbitrary user-selected data. It forks a configurable number of child processes
to handle many requests/responses simultaneously. Pipelines b/w browser process and the web
are managed with iptables (linux).
